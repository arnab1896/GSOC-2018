# USERS:

As a user, you can get access to using this analytics project to analyse, explore, search and graphically simulate the embryogenesis process of C.elegans nematode.

Firstly, you need to understand what toolbox for analysis you have. For that, please go through the main README.md file in the main repository of this project. There are a number of features and functionalities in the project. Most of them have a command line interface that can be used on any Linux based system. Apart from that, a few features also pipeline the output to a file format called *.gml.

**"*.gml"** is format of storing and representing data that is compatible with graphical simulator applications. The one that is being used in this project is Gephi. So, on gephi, you can input some of these *.gml that are generated to find the graphical correlation of the nodes/cells as they have progressed through the cell division generations.

All feedback and suggestions for improving the project more than welcome!
