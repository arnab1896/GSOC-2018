   - Firstly Excel/CSV data needs to be converted to XML format as a first step in processing
   - Second step is to convert it into some compatible graphical XML schema that will be decided depending on the application being used
   - As can be seen from project component chart, the data is being used in different parts.
   - This repository acts as a house/origin for all those various formats of data. This is where it all begins
